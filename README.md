# Hakyll static site generator

![build] ![license] ![release]

I occasionally need to build static web sites, and want a good site build tool.
[Hakyll] is that tool.

The default Hakyll site template is nowhere near where I want it to be, so this 
is a base state for a Hakyll site which isn't a blog, and which uses 
[Bootstrap] as its base styling.
